# CSS Layout-Overflow

The CSS `overflow` property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit into an area.

### CSS Overflow

The `overflow` property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.

The `overflow` property has the following values:

* `visible` - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
* `hidden` - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
* `scroll` - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
* `auto` - Similar to `scroll`, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary
