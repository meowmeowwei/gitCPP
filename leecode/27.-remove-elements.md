# 27. Remove Elements



Given an array _nums_ and a value _val_, remove all instances of that value [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O\(1\) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Example 1:**

```text
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.

Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```



Answer

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int i=0;
        for(int j =0; j < nums.size(); j++){
            if(nums[j]!=val){
                nums[i] = nums[j];
                i++;
            }
        }
        return i;
    }
};
```
