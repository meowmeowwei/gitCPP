# Spring Boot



### Advantages of Spring Boot

* It creates **stand-alone** Spring applications that can be started using Java **-jar**.
* It tests web applications easily with the help of different **Embedded** HTTP servers such as **Tomcat, Jetty,** etc. We don't need to deploy WAR files.
* It provides opinionated '**starter**' POMs to simplify our Maven configuration.
* It provides **production-ready** features such as **metrics, health checks,** and **externalized configuration**.
* There is no requirement for **XML** configuration.
* It offers a **CLI** tool for developing and testing the Spring Boot application.
* It offers the number of **plug-ins**.
* It also minimizes writing multiple **boilerplate codes** \(the code that has to be included in many places with little or no alteration\), XML configuration, and annotations.
* It **increases productivity** and reduces development time.
